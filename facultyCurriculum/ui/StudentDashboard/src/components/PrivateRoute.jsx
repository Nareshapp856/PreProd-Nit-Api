/**
 * PrivateRoute Component - Restricts access to certain routes based on user roles or exceptions.
 *
 * This component checks the user's role against a list of allowed roles for a specific route.
 * If the user's role matches or if their username is in the exceptions list, they are granted access.
 * Otherwise, they are redirected to the "/unauthorized" page.
 *
 * @param {React.ElementType} element - The component to be rendered if access is granted.
 * @param {Array<string>} allowedRoles - A list of roles that are permitted to access the route.
 * @param {Array<string>} exceptions - A list of userNames that are given access despite their roles.
 *
 * @returns {JSX.Element} - The specified component if access is allowed, or a redirect to "/unauthorized" if not.
 *
 * TODO: Improve security by integrating Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) more thoroughly.
 * Consider adding stronger validation and potentially a centralized security management system.
